# omniscroll
scrolling in any direction, without clicking, over tiled content
responsive to viewport size

Hover near the border to move in any direction around the tile grid.
Click a tile to expand it, move back to the border to close it.


## How it Works
<img width="500" alt="omniscroll_illustration" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2145f2b-6b6b-44a1-9afd-a8e724b926a9">

The tile grid is larger than the viewable area. When the mouse gets close to the sticky border, it brings the nearest tile _outside_ the viewable area, _inside_ the viewable area.
This can happen in any direction, so it's like scrolling in any direction.

The grid is generated by tile_scroll.js with parameters for the number of rows and columns.

## Building Upon This

Ideas:
- Dynamically load content into the tiles
- Auto play video content on hover
- Implement the tiles as search results, click a tile to focus the next search around that tile's theme (NLP thing)

## Demo
note: animation lag is from screen recorder limitations
